What Is TorQ?
===============

Data Intellect TorQ is a comprehensive framework built on top of the kdb+ database system. It serves as the foundation for creating production-ready kdb+ systems by providing core functionality and utilities that allow developers to focus on building application business logic. TorQ incorporates numerous best practices, emphasizing performance, maintainability, supportability and extensibility.

Key features of Data Intellect TorQ include process management, code management, configuration management, usage logging, connection management (both incoming and outgoing), access controls, timer extensions, standard output/error logging, error handling, documentation and development tools. Currently TorQ within Managed kdb Insights is a minimum viable product (MVP), meaning that not all TorQ functionality has been implemented but in future iterations more functionality will be added.
